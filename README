scrum.tmbundle
==============

TextMate Bundle that allows for a text file based scrum process. Right now, it's all about the user stories. They look like that:

00 02 Some User Story description

First column being the ID, second one being the effort. The bundle has

- a snipplet for creating stories (item + TAB)
- a shortcut to count the total effort within a file
- a shortcut to automatically renumber the stories

Might be expanded in the future, together with the basecrum project (check out http://github.com/effkay)
